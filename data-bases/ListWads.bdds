long_description: 10x10.wad is a modest set of 10 BOOM-compatible maps made as mapping exercises in which I restricted myself to using ten stock textures and ten stock FLATs in each (with some universal textures such as switches, doors, DOORTRAK, lights, etc.)* Pistol starts are intended but I won't put a gun to your head. In addition, there is a secret map that will probably be unpopular.$/n$ $/n$ *An out of bounds area in MAP01 showcases this universal texturebank for any nerd interested. Also, I cheated with ALLBLK for the void sections, sue me.
